## Keeping This Updated

This memory-bank directory is self-documenting and should stay current:

- **currentWork.md:** Update at session start and end
- **nextUp.md:** Update when priorities change
- **Guides:** Update when workflows change
- **Core docs:** Update when architecture changes

**Archive old sessions** to `04-history/sessions/YYYY-MM/` (not yet created - future enhancement)
